# Temperature Distribution in East Java
Simple Dashboard to visualize temperature distribution in East Java Province in Indonesia. There is also temperature means comparison between 2 cities in this app. 
I use Django and Ploty Dash to handle the web app, and Airflow to handle ETL behind the scenes. 
Tis web app is deployed in GCP until free credits expired ( around end of July 2023)
